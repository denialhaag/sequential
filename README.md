This repository supports arxiv.23XX:XXXXX. The directory `functions` is taken from the [RTNI package](https://github.com/MotohisaFukuda/RTNI).

Note that the bond dimension is denoted by $\xi$ instead of $D$.

## Supporting Material for Results in One Dimension

`analytical_evidence.nb` shows that Conjecture 1 holds for  $k \in \lbrace 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$.

`numerical_evidence.nb` provides numerical evidence suggesting that Conjecture 1 holds for  $k \in \lbrace 5, 6, 7 \rbrace$.

`mps_norm.nb` supports Appendix H.

## Supporting Material for Results in Two Dimensions

`iso_norm.nb` supports Appendix N.
